              Soap eliminates 99% of germs. 
              <br>You are the surviving 1%, the Germ1%.
              <br></br>
              In this top-down shooter you'll be the last germ standing, blasting at approaching bubbles in order to survive as long as possible.

              Hit bubbles with the right color to trigger a chain reaction!

              <b>MalagaJam Weekend 19</b>
              <br></br>
              Because I'm in the fourth year of my education, I went to Malaga with my class for a week.
              It was super fun and Malaga was very beautiful!
              <br></br>
              The main event during the trip was the <a href="https://malagajam.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>MalagaJam</i></a>, which took place from January 24 to 26, 2025.
              <br>
              There were 450 participants at the MalagaJam and the theme was "Bubbles".
              <br></br>
              I collaborated with a friend and 4 talented Spanish participants to develop a game with Unity.
              <br>
              I'm very proud of what we've made within 48 hours and I enjoyed the MalagaJam a lot.
              <br></br>
              <b>What did I learn?</b>
              <br></br>
              <i>Working together as a complete team</i>
              <br></br>
              We had 2 programmers, a UI designer, a sprite artist, a cinematic artist and an audio designer.
              <br>
              This meant that we can create a complete game with the roles we have.
              Designing the game idea went pretty smooth and even the dividing of roles went nicely.
              <br></br>
              After 48 hours of working on the game, we managed to have the following:
              <br>
              - <a href="https://youtu.be/0pLU3lHtjc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Trailer</i></a> for the game
              <br>
              - Game intro + main menu & settings menu
              <br>
              - Translation options for English and Spanish
              <br>
              - Infinite gameplay loop with waves of enemies
              <br>
              - Sprites for every asset
              <br>
              - Music for the game and many sound effects
              <br></br>
              <i>MalagaJam is amazing</i>
              <br></br>
              During the MalagaJam they hosted fun events like frisbee, ping pong and a bingo.
              You could say that they were really good at distracting us from working at the game, but I didn't mind it at all and participated in all of them.
              <br></br>
              After 48 hours of hard work, the MalagaJam ended and you could walk around freely looking at <a href="https://itch.io/jam/malagajam-weekend-19/entries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>everyone's games</i></a>.
              It was cool to see what everyone made and some games were super impressive that they were made in 48 hours.
              <br></br>
              I would've never found out about the MalagaJam without the school trip and I would love to go again next year.
              <br>
              Since I'm graduating this year though, redoing the year just to go to Malaga again isnâ€™t an option. 
              <br>
              However, I might participate again in the future or perhaps find an alternative in the Netherlands.
              <br></br>
