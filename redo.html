              <b>What's the game about?</b>
              <br></br>
              Redo is a platformer game about collecting abilities.
              <br>
              Each time you beat a level, you gain a new ability.
              The end of a level is a new beginning and with each ability a new path opens up.
              The goal is to unlock every ability and use them to beat the final level.
              Can you beat Redo?
              <br></br>
              <b>Why did I make this project?</b>
              <br></br> 
              During the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Brackeys game jam 2023.1</i></a> the theme was "An end is a new beginning".
              I had joined the game jam at that time and made <a href="https://pastebin.com/9tAgUgz0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>a game idea</i></a> for it.
              I never finished the game and only spent a couple days on it.
              <br></br>
              During my internship I started a new project, with the same game idea.
              This project is called Redo and I made a <a href="https://jmp.sh/663bn7hb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>game design document</i></a> for it which contains everything.
              <br></br>
              <b>What did I learn?</b>
              <br></br>
              I got better at making game design documents and working with the agile workway.
              Because I worked in sprints, I managed to complete a level every month. 
              <br> This includes playtesting and planning ahead.      
              <br></br>
              During the development of Redo, I got better at game design. 
              When I made the fake floor puzzle in the first level, I didn't like how it turned out to be.
              I completely remade the puzzle and even added a "tutorial" (if you fall, a text explanation appears).
              If you are struggling with this puzzle, the game helps you too. 
              After failing the puzzle 5 times, the correct tiles will turn green once stepped on.
              <br></br>
              <b>Other Information</b>
              <br></br>
              Redo took me 3 months to make in Unity (around 40 hours per week) and you can play it on Windows.
