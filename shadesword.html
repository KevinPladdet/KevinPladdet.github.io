              <b>What's the game about?</b>
              <br></br>
              ShadeSword is a 3D Action-Stealth game where stealth is only an afterthought. 
              Whether you sneak around all enemies, beat them up individually or take them out silently, as long as you can get to the end youâ€™ll have won the game.
              <br></br>
              <b>Team Project</b>
              <br></br>
              I made this game in a group with 6 other programmers.
              The game took us 2 months to make and was made with Unity.
              <br></br>
              <b>Planning</b>
              <br></br>
              We designed the game using a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12WtjpQqYu_oYE8p5je8wy0ZJ3BMP5Xa9MPwGcX_xxB4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Game Design Document</i></a>, which really helps us understand how exactly we're going to make the game.
              After the Game Design Document was finished, we started dividing the tasks and made a backlog with <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ds0TWhi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Trello</i></a>.
              <br></br>
              <b>SCRUM</b>
              <br></br>
              We used SCRUM as our working method, so we had a sprint every 2 weeks.
              A sprint is a deadline where everyone has to finish their tasks.
              After a sprint was done, a new one would be made.
              <br></br>
              <b>Why is the game not finished?</b>
              <br></br>
              The game isn't finished because some of my group members did not finish their parts in time. 
              This is a shame, since the idea of the game is really cool.
              <br></br>
              <b>What did I make?</b>
              <br></br>
              I made the inventory, including the healing / kunai / health bar.
              Besides that I also made scriptable objects, the death menu / win menu and a bit of the level design.
              Lastly all of the sounds you can hear in the video are all added by myself too, the sounds include: Healing SFX - Kunai SFX, Damage taken SFX, Switching through inventory SFX.
