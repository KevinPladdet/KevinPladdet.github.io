              <b>What's the game about?</b>
              <br></br>
              AquaMystics is a game about managing your fish to make enough money to clean the tank.
              <br></br>
              You can buy different fish and each fish has a different price and passive income.
              Every fish needs food to survive, so you can feed them by clicking left click anywhere in the tank.
              <br></br>
              <b>Why did I make this project?</b>
              <br></br>
              I made this game to prepare for a school exam, for which I have to create a game. 
              <br></br>
              While making AquaMystics I made a <a href="https://jmp.sh/Ju6R4xAc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>game design document</i></a> 
              which contains everything about the game. 
              <br>
              It also includes a TDD (technical design document) where I explain how I'm going to code everything.
              <br></br>
              I had 3 sprints in total (1 week per sprint) and used Trello to plan everything.
              <br></br>
              <b>What did I learn?</b>
              <br></br>
              <i>Technical Design Document</i>
              <br></br>
              I have never made a TDD before making this project, but it's pretty nice to use. 
              While I was working in Unity on the game, I knew exactly what to do and how to do it.
              <br>
              This is all because I made the GDD/TDD before I created the Unity project.
              <br></br>
              My next project will be for the school exam, so it's nice to already have some experience with making a FDD (functional design document) and TDD.
              <br></br>
              <i>Permanent Shop</i>
              <br></br>
              I learned how to make a permanent shop by using PlayerPrefs to store the currency.
              This means that if you close and reopen the game you'll still have the permanent currency you earned.
              <br></br>
              There are many possibilities on what permanent upgrades to add, but the only thing I added is a background changer.
              If you buy the background changer, you can choose between 5 backgrounds through a menu.
              <br></br>
              I would add more permanent upgrades, but I have stopped developing this game to work on something else.
              <br>
              I'm definitely going to add a permanent shop in one of my future projects though, since it's a very cool feature.
              <br></br>
              <b>Other Information</b>
              <br></br>
              AquaMystics took me 4 weeks to make in Unity (around 12 hours per week) and you can play it on Windows.
