            <b>Collaborative Project</b>
            <br></br>
            I worked on this project during my internship with <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/beau-verwimp-33a079223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Beau Verwimp</i></a> and <a href="https://www.behance.net/HindAna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Hind Anajay</i></a>.
            <br></br>
            Hind is a digital design & media student, and made a comic during the internship.
            <br></br>
            Beau is a software developer student, so he would make the website for the comic.
            <br></br>
            My goal was to make a game that was related to the comic and would appear on the website.
            <br></br>
            The working method we used was "scrum" and we used Trello to keep track of our tasks.
            We made 2 sprints of 2 weeks, so we could get everything done within a month.
            <br></br>
            We worked on this project for a month and managed to get everything done in the end.
            <br></br>
            <b>What's the game about?</b>
            <br></br>
            Project S is a rhythm game, where the goal is to get the highest score possible.
            <br></br>
            There are 4 buttons you can press, each button being a different row.
            When the song starts, notes will start falling. Once a note is inside of a button, you need to press that button.
            If you press it perfectly, you will get more score than if you'd press it late or early.
            <br></br>
            There is also a score multiplier depending on how many notes you hit in a row.
            If you miss a note, the score multiplier goes back to x1.
            <br></br>
            Once the song ends, a results screen will appear. 
            <br>
            On the results screen you can see how many times you hit each note, how many times you missed a note, 
            your total score and your rank.
            <br></br>
            At the start of the game there is a controls menu.
            <br>
            In this menu the player can input their own controls, instead of the default ones.
            <br>
            If the player inputs an invalid or duplicate input, the game can not be started until it has been changed to a valid input.
            <br></br>
