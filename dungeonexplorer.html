              <b>What's the game about?</b>
              <br></br>
              Dungeon Explorer is a 3D game about exploring a dungeon to uncover treasures and to defeat monsters.
              <br></br>
              The game has polygon assets for all of the game objects and has controller support as well.
              <br></br>
              <b>Why did I make this project?</b>
              <br></br>
              Making a 3D game takes a lot of work and usually I don't manage to use assets for everything.
              The goal of this game was to make a nice exploration / adventure game that has assets for every game object.
              <br></br>
              I also wanted to try and add controller support, because 
              it's pretty cool and will be usesful to learn for future projects.
              <br></br>
              <b>What did I learn?</b>
              <br></br>

              <i>I learned how to get assets and how to use them</i>
              <br></br>
              The <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Unity Asset Store</i></a> 
              is perfect for finding asset packs, because there are thousands on there. 
              <br>
              I also used <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/software"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Humble Bundle</i></a> 
              to buy a polygon assets bundle, which I ended up using for the game.
              <br></br>
              <i>Scriptable Objects</i>
              <br></br>
              Scriptable objects are really nice to use, because it keeps the code clean.
              I used scriptable objects to give each enemy different stats, like health, movement speed, etc.
              <br></br>
              <i>Main Menu / Settings Menu</i>
              <br></br>
              In most, if not all of my games I have a main menu and settings menu.
              They're all pretty basic, but they function. Isn't that what matters?
              <br></br>
              Wrong. For Dungeon Explorer I acted like the main menu and settings menu was the most important thing ever.
              <br></br>
              My goals were the following: 
              <br></br>- Moving background on the main menu & settings menu
              <br>- Be able to access the settings menu from the game scene
              <br>- FOV slider + sensitivity slider
              <br></br>
              I had already made a FOV slider and sensitivity slider for Redo, so I did the same things to make it work 
              for Dungeon Explorer.
              <br></br>
              In every game I made up until now, my main menu and settings menu were in a different scene than the game scene.
              This was a problem, because if you would go back to the main menu, it would not save your progress on the game scene.
              <br></br>
              To fix this I made the main menu and settings menu in the same scene as the game.
              This also helped me make the moving backgrounds, because I added 2 cameras that show
              the beautiful atmosphere. Depending on what menu you're in would decide what camera enables.
              <br></br>
              <i>Controller Support</i>         
              <br></br>
              To add controller support I used 
              <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.8/manual/index.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Unity's new input system</i></a>.
              With this I could make multiple control profiles, one for mouse and keyboard and the other for controller.
              <br></br>
              I had a bit of an annoying time trying to figure out how it works, but once it clicked I didn't mind it too much.
              <br></br>
              Even when you interact with objects in the game, if you have a controller connected it will display the controller interaction button.
              
              <br></br>
              <b>Other Information</b>
              <br></br>
              Dungeon Explorer took me 10 weeks to make in Unity (around 10 hours per week) and you can play it on Windows.
