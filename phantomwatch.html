              <b>What's the game about?</b>
              <br></br>
              Inspired by “I'm on Observation Duty”, which is a game about detecting & banishing anomalies. 
              <br></br>
              You are a Phantom Watch employee. Your job is to carefully inspect the facility through the security system.
              <br>Any paranormal activity must be identified and banished.
              <br></br>
              Can you make it through the night?
              <br></br>
              <b>Team Exam</b>
              <br></br>
              I made this game for a school exam together with 3 friends.
              For the exam we had to create a game with design documents and also document others playtesting it. 
              <br></br>
              We started with creating a <a href="https://linen-mahogany-370.notion.site/FDD-Horror-Game-134bcdff655f80eab6f7ef7f243ab79e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>FDD</i></a> (functional design document) which contains everything about the game.
              <br></br>
              After the FDD, we created a <a href="https://linen-mahogany-370.notion.site/TDD-Horror-Game-134bcdff655f8009837ae523a625f02a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>TDD</i></a> (technical design document) where we explain how we're going to code everything.
              <br></br>
              During the exam we let others <a href="https://linen-mahogany-370.notion.site/Playtesting-14cbcdff655f809986dfcd7756a79267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>playtest</i></a> the game, which gave us valuable feedback on what we could improve on.
              <br></br>
              We had 3 sprints in total (1 week per sprint) and used Notion to plan everything.
              <br></br>
              <b>What did I learn?</b>
              <br></br>
              <i>Notion</i>
              <br></br>
              I have never used Notion before, but one of my friends had some experience with it and said it was good.
              <br></br>
              On Notion you can create documents very easily, so we had the FDD and TDD + the kanban board all together.
              <br>
              It also includes live updates on changes, so it was easy to work together in Notion.
              <br></br>
              The planning went well too, since we first made all the tasks and then divided them.
              During the project there were some sick days between others and one of their laptops broke down too, but we still managed to create effective solutions for that.  
              <br></br>
              <i>Handling merge conflicts</i>
              <br></br>
              To prevent merge conflicts, everyone had their own folders for scripts/assets/scenes/etc.
              This made merge conflicts impossible, unless we started working in eachothers folders.
              <br></br>
              We would always ask eachother if it was safe to work in them, so we never got a merge conflict during the entire project.
              <br></br>
              <b>Other Information</b>
              <br></br>
              Phantom Watch took us 3 weeks to make in Unity (around 15 hours per week) and you can play it on Windows.

              <br></br>
              The game uses HDRP shaders, so a WebGL build is not possible. You can download and play Phantom Watch yourself by clicking <a href=" https://www.mediafire.com/file/i5bswezc9wwc2u4/Phantom_Watch_0.5.zip/file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>here</i></a>.</span>
