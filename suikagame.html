              <b>What's the game about?</b>
              <br></br>
              Suika Game is a game about merging fruits.
              The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible.
              If a piece of fruit touches the top of the box, you lose.
              Can you get a watermelon?
              <br></br>
              <b>Why did I make this project?</b>
              <br></br>
              Before I made Suika Game, I was working on Redo for several months.
              I got burned out from working on it and decided I wanted to work on a small project.
              I had watched and played Suika Game for quite a bit, so I figured it'd be fun to try making it myself.
              <br></br>
              <b>What did I learn?</b>
              <br></br>
              While making this project I learned how to break down the original Suika Game into all of its mechanics.
              I made a task in Trello for each mechanic of Suika Game and started making them one by one.
              Once they were all done, I put everything together.
              <br></br>
              When the game was done, I decided it would be fun to add an "Admin Mode". 
              Whenever Admin Mode is on, the player can drag and drop every fruit. 
              The trigger that ends the game is disabled, so the player can not lose.
              This mode is basically a cheat mode, but its a lot of fun to use.          
              <br></br>
              <b>Other Information</b>
              <br></br>
              Suika Game took me 2 weeks to make in Unity (around 40 hours per week) and you can play it on Windows. 
              <br></br>
