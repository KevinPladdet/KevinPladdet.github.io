              <b>What's the game about?</b>
              <br></br>
              Inspired by “Vampire Survivors”, which is a survival game with roguelite elements. 
              <br></br>
              In this game you can level up by killing enemies and each time you level up you will be rewarded with a weapon or upgrade. 
              The game gets progressively harder, so death is inevitable. 
              <br></br>
              How long can you survive?
              <br></br>
              <b>Why did I make this project?</b>
              <br></br>
              I made this game for a school exam, for which I have to create a game. 
              I also had to make game design documents for it and document others playtesting it.
              <br></br>
              I started with creating a <a href="https://pastebin.com/1Fhy5sPZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>FDD</i></a> (functional design document) which contains everything about the game.
              <br></br>
              After the FDD, I created a <a href="https://pastebin.com/V3X6zbFF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>TDD</i></a> (technical design document) where I explain how I'm going to code everything.
              <br></br>
              During the exam I let others <a href="https://pastebin.com/4c7Jmuhi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>playtest</i></a> the game, which gave me valuable feedback on what I could improve on.
              <br></br>
              I had 5 sprints in total (1 week per sprint) and used <a href="https://imgur.com/a/lrTFHRF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Trello</i></a> to plan everything.
              <br></br>
              <b>What did I learn?</b>
              <br></br>
              <i>Tilemap + Spritesheets</i>
              <br></br>
              I've never used a tilemap before, but I knew that I needed it for this game.
              I also found the spritesheets that the original game used and used them for my game too.
              <br></br>
              There was one problem though, the creator of the spritesheets sucked at making spritesheets.
              The sprites weren't the same height and the background also wasn't transparent.
              <br></br>
              Another bad thing was that for objects, he would put a grass background on it.
              Which means that you can't put the background on a stone floor for example, without removing it manually.
              It was a lot of effort to remove the backgrounds and to make the sprites work, but I got it done in the end.
              <br></br>
              The map in the game is pretty big too, so I'm happy I learned how to use tilemaps instead of placing them manually.
              <br></br>
              <i>There are so many more things I could add</i>
              <br></br>
              While making the FDD I listed many things that I wanted to add, but knew I didn't have time for.
              This includes the permanent shop, upgrade system, boss fights, character selection, animations and more weapons/passives.
              <br></br>
              I have another game exam after this one, which means I won't have time to add these features.
              Nonetheless I'm very proud of what I've made so far, it looks really good!
              <br></br>
              <b>Other Information</b>
              <br></br>
              Vampire Survivors Clone took me 5 weeks to make in Unity (around 12 hours per week) and you can play it on Windows.
